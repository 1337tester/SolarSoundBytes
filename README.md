# SolarSoundBytes
*Mapping our global transition to solar energy into bite-sized audio insights.*


**SolarSoundBytes** is a data-driven AI project that explores the connection between **public sentiment** and **renewable energy development**, combining **geospatial analysis, natural language processing, and audio generation.**

The project begins by **analyzing public sentiment** on Twitter regarding renewable energy topics, incorporating both geolocation and timestamp data for each tweet. This allows us to map how opinions around clean energy evolve over time and across different regions.

We then explore **potential correlations between changes in renewable energy production and shifts in public sentiment**, focusing specifically on environmental and spatial factors (even though economic and political variables also play a role).

**If a correlation is found**, we take it a step further by **predicting how renewable energy production might change** in the future, based on current sentiment trends and environmental context.

These insights are used to generate **concise summaries**, combining the sentiment analysis with relevant news articles. The summaries are transformed into short, informative **audio clips—soundbytes—featuring natural voice narration**.

These soundbytes are designed to educate, engage, and influence public perception around renewable energy and sustainability.
