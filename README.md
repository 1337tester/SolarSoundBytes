# SolarSoundBytes
Mapping our global transition to solar energy into bite-sized audio insights.

This project explores the correlation between sentiment analysis of tweets and the development of renewable energy narratives. Using news articles as training data, a model will generate sound bites—short audio clips—that aim to influence public opinion. These clips will reflect prevailing sentiments and help communicate key messages about renewable energy in a concise, engaging format.
