the climate change deception preparing for a pole shift and the hidden agenda of the global elite the climate change movement has gained significant traction in recent years with urgent calls to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources however beneath the surface of this seemingly noble cause lies a massive deception linked to an impending cataclysm a pole shift this essay delves into the work of chan thomas in the adam and eve story explores the hidden dealings of technology and uncovers the true motivations of the global elite by examining the evidence it becomes apparent that the push for lower carbon emissions and the development of advanced technologies serve a far more sinister purpose preparing hermetically sealed bunkers for a select few to survive the coming pole shift additionally the actions described as being for continuity of government can also be interpreted through this lens further supporting this theory moreover this parallel society which includes the global elite are actually the aliens who have been here through many of these cataclysms explaining the conspiratorial connections between the mafia intelligence services government media and the occult chan thomass the adam and eve story presents a controversial but compelling narrative about cataclysmic pole shifts that have periodically devastated earth according to thomas these shifts occur when the earths crust slips over its core causing massive geological and climatic upheavals this theory posits that such events have wiped out previous civilizations and will inevitably happen again the book suggests that the last pole shift occurred around 11500 years ago leading to the demise of advanced ancient civilizations if thomass hypothesis is accurate it would explain the urgent albeit covert preparations being made by those in power a critical aspect of these preparations involves technology the global elites push for lower carbon emissions ostensibly aims to combat climate change but it also conveniently aligns with the needs of hermetically sealed bunkers in a closed environment co2 levels can quickly become hazardous making the reduction of carbon emissions a top priority this hidden agenda explains the fervor behind policies promoting alternative energy and electric vehicles evs renewable energy sources and evs reduce reliance on fossil fuels which produce co2 thus ensuring a safer environment within these bunkers moreover the advancement of artificial intelligence ai and robotics is crucial for maintaining bunker facilities robots do not require oxygen food or water and can perform tasks tirelessly making them ideal for sustaining life in a sealed environment this explains the significant investments in ai and robotics by major corporations and governments these technologies are not merely for enhancing productivity or convenience but are essential components of a survival strategy for the elite the allocation of resources further supports this theory despite public claims of resource shortages and economic constraints vast sums of money have been funneled into the development of these technologies the missing resources in the global economy are likely being diverted to build and stock these advanced bunkers this hidden parallel society is preparing for the pole shift by creating a selfsustaining infrastructure that can endure the coming cataclysm the evidence suggests that this clandestine operation has been ongoing for a long time throughout history civilizations have risen and fallen often leaving behind traces of advanced technology that seem out of place these remnants could be evidence of previous societies that prepared for and survived past pole shifts the elites current preparations indicate that they have access to hidden knowledge and technology which they use to ensure their survival while keeping the masses in the dark the concept of continuity of government cog further reinforces this theory cog refers to the plans and protocols established to ensure that government operations can continue during and after catastrophic events these measures include the construction of secure underground facilities the development of advanced communication networks and the establishment of emergency protocols while these actions are publicly justified as necessary for national security they also align perfectly with the preparations for surviving a pole shift the infrastructure and technology being developed for cog could easily double as the means for the global elite to weather a cataclysmic event in relative safety what becomes even more intriguing is the realization that this parallel society preparing for the pole shift are actually the aliens who have been present on earth through many of these cataclysms this ancient hidden society has manipulated humanity throughout history using advanced technology and knowledge to maintain their dominance this perspective explains the numerous conspiratorial connections between the mafia intelligence services government media and the occult these entities are all part of a coordinated effort to control and prepare for the inevitable pole shift leveraging their power to ensure their survival while the rest of humanity remains oblivious the climate change movement therefore serves as a convenient cover for these preparations by promoting the narrative of manmade climate change the global elite can implement policies and direct resources without arousing suspicion the focus on reducing carbon emissions and developing renewable energy sources aligns with the needs of their hermetically sealed bunkers while the public remains unaware of the true nature of the threat additionally the emphasis on cog measures further supports the elites preparation for a pole shift as these actions ensure their survival and control in the aftermath of such an event the climate change movement is part of a massive deception linked to the potential coming cataclysm of a pole shift chan thomass work in the adam and eve story provides a plausible explanation for the elites covert preparations the push for lower carbon emissions the development of advanced technologies and the diversion of resources all point to a hidden agenda ensuring the survival of a select few in hermetically sealed bunkers during the next pole shift the concept of continuity of government further supports this theory as the measures taken for national security align with the preparations for surviving a cataclysmic event this hidden society consisting of ancient aliens who have influenced human history has been using humanity to build and maintain their infrastructure preparing for a cataclysm that has been prophesied and anticipated for millennia as we continue to invest in technologies that seem beneficial on the surface we must remain vigilant and question the true motivations behind these advancements the evidence suggests that we are pawns in a much larger game orchestrated by those with knowledge of an impending disaster and the means to survive it,2024-06-16,0.142989859,0.8570101261

riyadh june 24 2024 spa in the presence of his royal highness prince abdulaziz bin salman bin abdulaziz al saud minister of energy the geographic survey project for renewable energy sites in the kingdom was launched the contracts for the project were awarded to saudi companies to install 1200 stations for measuring solar and wind energy across all regions of the kingdom in a statement on the signing of the project‚Äôs contracts hrh the minister of energy stated that this project which is a part of the national renewable energy program is globally unprecedented in terms of geographical coverage he noted that the project will include all regions of the kingdom by surveying over 850000 square kilometers excluding populated areas sand dune areas and airspace restrictions he clarified 2 that this area is equivalent to the land area of entire countries such as approximately the areas of the uk and france combined or germany and spain combined he indicated that no other country in the world has previously conducted a geographic survey of this kind on such an area scale the minister added that the project will contribute to identifying the best sites for developing renewable energy projects in the kingdoms regions in terms of the size of renewable energy resources and the priority of developing these projects regarding the comprehensiveness of the data the project will provide his royal highness noted that in the first phase the stations will survey the designated area spreading into all regions of the kingdom to identify suitable sites for renewable energy projects subsequently the project‚Äôs stations will be moved to these sites and installed there to continuously provide all required data for implementing renewable energy projects with high accuracy the minister of energy also explained that solar energy measurement stations equipped with advanced measurement devices at ground level will record direct normal irradiance dni global horizontal irradiance ghi diffuse horizontal irradiance dhi dust and pollutant deposition rates groundreflected radiation albedo ambient temperature rainfall levels relative humidity and atmospheric pressure meanwhile wind energy measurement stations which will be installed at different heights up to 120 meters will record wind speed and direction ambient temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity his royal highness indicated that data collection will be conducted using the latest technologies and applying the highest quality standards and global practices 3 hrh the minister added that the project includes establishing a platform at the ministry of energy to monitor record and transmit measurement data around the clock so that it can be analyzed and processed digitally using artificial intelligence technologies to assess and rank sites based on their suitability for renewable energy projects in this context the minister noted that the accuracy and continuous updating of the project‚Äôs data make it financeable in accordance with the requirements of local and international financial institutions he added that this will contribute significantly to the immediate allocation of land lots for renewable energy projects and expedite project announcement and execution after coordination with relevant authorities this eliminates the current waiting period of 18 to 24 months to obtain data he also noted that the availability of such data reduces the risks related to renewable energy projects implementation increases such projects‚Äô investment attractiveness and encourages investors to participate in the development of and investment in renewable energy projects his royal highness emphasized that this project reaffirms the kingdoms commitment to achieving its ambitious targets for producing and exporting renewable energy as it will optimize the utilization of renewable energy resources across the kingdom support the kingdoms strategic position for exporting electricity generated from renewable resources and promote the kingdoms aim to produce clean hydrogen the project will also primarily contribute to achieving the optimal energy mix targets for electricity production with renewable energy sources comprising about 50 of the energy mix by 2030 and to achieving the goals of the liquid fuel displacement program by reducing dependence on liquid fuel in electricity generation his royal highness added that starting from this year 2024 the kingdom will tender new renewable energy projects with a capacity of 20 gigawatts annually aiming to reach between 100 and 130 gigawatts by 2030 depending on electricity demand growth 4 concluding his statement his royal highness the minister of energy expressed his gratitude and appreciation to the custodian of the two holy mosques king salman bin abdulaziz al saud and to his royal highness crown prince mohammed bin salman bin abdulaziz al saud prime minister and chairman of the supreme committee for energy mix affairs for electricity production and enabling the renewable energy sector for their continuous support and assistance to the ministry of energy and its ecosystem enhancing

there are multiple stories of communities rend asunder because of the renewable energy caravan coming to town there is the loss of arable land the loss of physical amenity the loss of local flora and fauna the massive disruption caused during the construction phase but these issues are dramatically downplayed by the ardent advocates of renewable energy a similar story applies to immigration and the failure to account for its external costs particularly in relation to housing the proponents of large migrant intakes ‚Äì and this includes the labor government and the coalition at least in the past ‚Äì take the view that these external costs can simply be dismissed because the benefits of immigration are so large dubious studies are undertaken to assess the net economic benefits of immigration but fail to account for the external costs it is ironic that these studies typically show only small positive net economic benefits that are generally only realised after two decades or so it is clear however that the migrants themselves benefit as do the owners of capital think here property developers big business and educational institutions as for the external costs there is sometimes reference to congestion pressure on public services loss of social cohesion and the impact on housing affordability but it is extremely rare to see any numbers attached to these external costs because they would need to be subtracted from any estimates of the small net benefits just as is the case wit renewable energy the winners from high rates of immigration particularly the universities think certain segments of society should simply wear these external costs because of some illdefined greater good promoting exports is a common rationale as well as bumping up the international rankings of our universities bear in mind here that the universities with their substantial international student enrolments pay no tax that might otherwise offset some of these external costs the link between immigration and the shortage of housing also leads directly to housing policies to which many local residents also object highdensity housing is promoted even if this involves overriding the preferences of those living in the affected areas the pejorative term nimby is used to undermine the legitimate property rights of homeowners who have purchased property along with an implicit assurance that the nature of the precinct is largely retained increasingly state governments are wont to override the planning responsibilities of local governments in order to promote the type of housing that can cope with a rapidly growing population caused mainly by immigration in some instances state governments have insisted that highrise apartments are built without any carparking leading to an explosion of cars being parked on local streets this is another example of an external cost being imposed on residents who previously enjoyed relatively uncrowded streets the big picture here is that optimal government policies always require an assessment of the full costs and benefits including external costs increasingly however singleminded policies have been guided by a paternalistic view of the paths to the greater good ‚Äì via promotion of renewable energy high migrant intakes highdensity housing ‚Äì with nary a thought for those adversely affected indeed in some cases those folk hurt by the policies are denigrated in the name of ramming through bad policies it‚Äôs only when the losers opt to fight back is there a chance of more balanced policy the revolts we are seeing in some regional and rural areas about the placement of intrusive renewable energy installations and transmission lines may be just the beginning politicians may need to take heed,2024-07-02,0.00292136264,0.9970786572

battery cost really puts a limit on how cheap renewable energy sources like solar and wind can get you need batteries to arbitrage demand or you get silly things like paying people to take your power so you can collect subsidies the economics for storing an entire day of energy generation isnt too bad if you can buy energy during surplus at 005 per kwh and turn around and sell it at peak demand for 015 per kwh you can earn 010 per kwh each kwh of battery storage is currently around 300 per kwh installed which is super low historically you then need 3000 charge and discharge cycles to make anything on this purchase you can only do one discharge cycle per day so this is over 8 years to pay back your investment tough i imagine most buyers of these installations want to see 3 year payback periods but you can obviously do better if the arbitrage value is higher but i dont want expensive electricity i want to pay 005 per kwh less even but the economics are impossible at those costs we can also end up with much lower installed costs for battery storage 50 per kwh i am not sure how low this can go unfortunately the economics will never be there for seasonal demand differences if you only discharge your battery once per year you can never make money i am not sure what fixes this huge power lines from north to south of the equator nuclear power excess energy to create artificial fuels i cant think of any solution that is capital efficient on the other hand getting to that point will be a huge win the following seems to suggest that 20 per kwh is needed to shift 100 to renewables feasible httpstcovr8pbbqus5,2024-07-02,0.001886296901,0.9981137514

chinas rapid expansion of renewable energy particularly solar and wind power has been significant with the country adding solar capacity at an even faster rate than the previous year in may 2024 china added 19 gw of solar capacity while the united states added only 24 gw this rapid deployment of renewable capacity has led to challenges in integrating this new energy into the existing grid infrastructure causing the country to idle increasing amounts of renewable generation when it overwhelms local grids the issue is compounded by the fact that chinas northern and western areas which are rich in energy resources and have become major centers for renewable energy generation are also some of the least populated and poorest parts of the country this means there is not enough local population and industry to absorb all the renewable energy output and there is a lack of longdistance transmission capacity to move the surplus to other areas in 2016 the national utilization rate for new energy sources fell to a record low of 84 prompting the central government to launch a clean energy absorption action plan to reduce the waste of renewable resources however with the continued rapid deployment of renewable capacity the problem of renewable energy waste is reemerging in the first five months of 2024 wind utilization fell to 961 and solar utilization fell to 96 to address these challenges chinas state grid corporation has constructed a network of ultrahigh voltage transmission lines to move power thousands of kilometers from surplus areas in the west and north to deficit areas in the east and south however more transmission capacity and better scheduling are needed to smooth out fluctuations across a larger number of generators spread over much larger areas of the country in a sign of the importance attached to this issue the communist partys politburo held a group study session on new energy technology and energy security on february 29 2024 new government regulations also aim to reduce the amount of renewable generation that has to be abandoned by increasing longdistance transmission links and better coordinating generation plans across provinces,2024-07-08,0.1393815428,0.8606184125

smart inverter breakthrough for renewable energy the news was brought to you by httpstcozhbckcuowq listen version httpstcocedqhqbkdm a technological leap csiro and googles smart inverter breakthrough in a groundbreaking collaboration australias national science agency csiro has joined forces with googles innovation arm to develop a cuttingedge gridforming inverter prototype this remarkable piece of technology promises to revolutionize the way we integrate renewable energy into our power grids potentially accelerating the global transition to sustainable power sources the new inverter technology a gamechanger for renewable energy imagine if you will a device no larger than your trusty laptop yet possessing the power to transform the future of energy distribution thats precisely what the team of brilliant minds from csiro and tapestry a part of google xs innovation hub have accomplished with their new inverter prototype this isnt your grandfathers inverter mind you no this little powerhouse is packed with more bells and whistles than a carnival parade at its core the prototype boasts embedded intelligence technology the same kind of smart systems that make electric vehicles zip around and keep autonomous drones from crashing into your neighbors prized rosebushes but what sets this inverter apart from its commercial cousins for starters its equipped with stateoftheart signal sensing and filtering hardware think of it as the inverter equivalent of noisecanceling headphones but instead of blocking out your chatty coworker its finetuning the electrical signals coursing through the grid add to that a suite of gridforming and microgrid software and youve got a device thats not just participating in the energy distribution game ‚Äì its changing the rules entirely benefits and capabilities a symphony of stability and efficiency now you might be wondering whats all this fancy tech actually good for well buckle up because the benefits are as impressive as they are numerous first and foremost these smart inverters are communication wizards they can chat with other devices on the grid like theyre old pals at a high school reunion solar panels batteries traditional generators ‚Äì you name it these inverters can talk to it this enhanced communication allows for a level of grid awareness that would make even the most attentive air traffic controller jealous but its not just about making friends these inverters use their newfound knowledge to keep the grid stable like a vigilant conductor ensuring every instrument in the orchestra plays in perfect harmony as john ward csiro energy systems research director puts it unlike their lesssavvy predecessors gridforming inverters can communicate with the grid they can discern precisely when to ramp up energy distribution and lets not forget about efficiency laboratory tests have shown that these prototypes could be up to 50 more costeffective to produce than current models thats like getting a twoforone deal on the future of energy distribution technical innovations silicon carbide and supersized capacity at the heart of this technological marvel lies a simple yet revolutionary change the shift from silicon to silicon carbide its like upgrading from a sturdy workhorse to a thoroughbred racehorse ‚Äì same basic idea but oh boy what a difference in performance this switch to silicon carbide isnt just about bragging rights though its a gamechanger that allows the inverter to withstand higher temperatures and voltages than its siliconbased predecessors its like giving the inverter a suit of armor and then telling it to charge into battle the results speak for themselves as leo casey tapestrys chief scientist and the mastermind behind this prototype explains weve designed an inverter that has around 50 higher energy density with about 50 faster response time at 99 efficiency all at about half the cost of a traditional commercial inverter now thats what i call a mic drop moment in the world of energy technology but wait theres more this pintsized powerhouse packs a punch that would make even the hulk green with envy well greener with a 300 kw output this single prototype has the capacity of 164 currently available inverters talk about downsizing without compromising on power conclusion a bright future for renewable energy integration as exciting as these laboratory results are the real test lies ahead the next phase of the project will see these smart inverters venturing out into the wild partnering with power distribution companies to prove their mettle in realworld conditions the potential impact of this technology cannot be overstated as stephen craig csiro smart energy mission lead points out australias currently sitting on a goldmine of renewable energy yet much of it goes to waste due to our inability to harness it effectively these gridforming inverters could be the key to unlocking that potential managing the flow of renewable energy into traditional grids with unprecedented precision they promise to eliminate the headaches of oversupply respond to demand fluctuations with the agility of a cat and banish blackouts to the annals of history in the grand scheme of things this collaboration between csiro and google represents more than just a technological advancement its a beacon of hope for australias renewable energy future and indeed for the global transition to sustainable power sources as we stand on the precipice of a new era in energy distribution one thing is clear the future is looking brighter than ever and its being powered by some very smart inverters dailynews worldnews globalnews latestnews listen2ai news2go tech technews csiro googlex smartinverter renewableenergy techinnovation

trumps policies will increase inflation trump said he would increase tariffs decrease taxes for the rich slow the progress of evs and renewable energy expel all undocumented labor keep social security benefits the same‚Ä¶ higher inflation for taxpayers and lower social security for retired citizens tariffs on foreign goods are just taxes passed on to the us citizen so higher inflation decreased taxes for the rich will increase the deficit so higher inflation removing undocumented labor will lead to higher labor costs and increased inflation keeping social security benefits the same sounds ‚Äúgood‚Äù but what he means is no increases for inflation which means yes lower us costs but at the expense of retired folks who will face higher inflation under trump and no adjustment for inflation that would be part of the labor force compensation as evs become cheaper and offer more range and faster charging the consumption of gasoline and diesel will shift to electric power electric power is about 70 less than the cost of gasoline and diesel citizens will save money on fuel but so will industry as the cost of fuel for trucks declines in short the shift to evs reduces inflation trump slowing that shift will increase inflation renewable energy for electric power generation is now cheaper than fossil fuels worldwide the shift to renewable power from wind solar and grid batteries is accelerating based on the cost savings and the cost advantages of renewables is getting better every year in one of two decades the shift to renewable energy will provide a major reduction in inflation the inflation reduction act encouraging a faster pace to renewables is the strongest program for reducing inflation,2024-07-08,0.006807853933,0.9931921363

fred lambert editorinchief of electrek has recently come under fire for his seemingly hypocritical stance on environmental issues while known for his strong advocacy for renewable energy his personal actions appear to contradict his public persona full details here mr lambert like all humans breathes out carbon dioxide co2 with every breath he takes this co2 contributes to the greenhouse effect trapping heat in the atmosphere and exacerbating global warming it seems that lambert despite his professed concern for the environment is actively contributing to the problem by simply existing furthermore lambert is no stranger to using products that generate nonrecyclable plastics and other waste that ends up in landfills this waste not only takes up valuable space but also releases harmful chemicals and gases as it decomposes further harming the environment mr lamberts actions raise questions about his true commitment to environmentalism is he merely paying lip service to the cause while continuing to engage in activities that harm the planet or is he simply unaware of the impact of his actions whatever the case may be one thing is clear lamberts actions do not align with his public advocacy for green initiatives if he truly wants to be a champion for the environment he must start by examining his own behavior and making changes that reflect his professed values this post was written with the help of grok ai if you have gotten this far sorry for hitting you with click bait but i hope i got my actual point across,2024-07-16,0.006034454331,0.9939655662

for your consideration mr goldstein the future of renewable energy addressing challenges and maximizing impact renewable energy has long been hailed as the solution to our global energy needs offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to hydrocarbons however recent research suggests that renewable energy is not living up to its full potential this article aims to shed light on the challenges faced by renewable energy sources and explore potential solutions for a more impactful and effective transition currently renewable energy sources meet approximately 12 of global energy requirements however a significant portion of this some 9 comes from the burning of biomass which releases co2 into the atmosphere this raises concerns about the overall effectiveness of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions solar panels and wind turbines often considered the poster children of renewable energy contribute only 3 to the global energy mix this raises questions about the significant investments made in these technologies over the years to maximize the impact of renewable energy it is essential to diversify the portfolio beyond solar panels and wind turbines investing in research and development of alternative technologies such as geothermal tidal and wave energy can offer new opportunities for cleaner and more efficient power generation by broadening the range of renewable options we can maybe overcome the limitations of individual technologies and create a more balanced energy mix while the transition to renewable energy is alleged to be crucial it is equally important to allocate resources to address pressing environmental challenges investing in the maintenance and construction of infrastructure to handle flooding providing resources to fight wildfires and building resilient cities for mass migration patterns are essential components of a holistic approach to approaching our needs as a species by striking a balance between renewable energy investments and adaptation measures we can create a more resilient future devoid of fearmongering by politicians the current contribution of solar panels and wind turbines to the global energy mix is extremely modest therefore it is crucial to wake up smell the coffee and strike a balance between ‚Äúrenewable‚Äù energy investments and addressing other pressing environmental challenges,2024-07-16,0.09456903487,0.9054309726

fact check the claim that ‚Äúchina is installing the wind and solar equivalent of five large nuclear power stations per week‚Äù is broadly accurate and reflects china‚Äôs rapid expansion in renewable energy china has significantly accelerated its renewable energy capacity installations in 2024 china added 457 gigawatts gw of solar photovoltaic pv capacity in just the first quarter this pace is part of china‚Äôs broader plan to reach over 1200 gw of installed wind and solar capacity by 2025 which is several years ahead of its initial target to put this into perspective a typical large nuclear power station has an output of around 1 gw china‚Äôs current renewable installation rates are indeed substantial for example adding 457 gw in a quarter translates to approximately 152 gw per month or around 38 gw per week when considering both wind and solar installations this figure approaches the equivalent output of multiple large nuclear power stations weekly the calculation of equivalence also considers the capacity factors of these technologies wind and solar have lower capacity factors compared to nuclear meaning their actual energy output over time is lower relative to their peak capacity despite this the sheer scale of china‚Äôs wind and solar projects effectively matches or exceeds the capacity additions of several nuclear reactors each week overall china‚Äôs aggressive expansion in renewable energy infrastructure supports the claim demonstrating a significant shift towards sustainable energy sources on a massive scale factcheck factcheck,2024-07-16,0.9984992743,0.001500783488

the future of renewable energy addressing challenges and maximizing impact renewable energy has long been hailed as the solution to our global energy needs offering a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to hydrocarbons however recent research suggests that renewable energy is not living up to its full potential this article aims to shed light on the challenges faced by renewable energy sources and explore potential solutions for a more impactful and effective transition currently renewable energy sources meet approximately 12 of global energy requirements however a significant portion of this some 9 comes from the burning of biomass which releases co2 into the atmosphere this raises concerns about the overall effectiveness of renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions solar panels and wind turbines often considered the poster children of renewable energy contribute only 3 to the global energy mix this raises questions about the significant investments made in these technologies over the years to maximize the impact of renewable energy it is essential to diversify the portfolio beyond solar panels and wind turbines investing in research and development of alternative technologies such as geothermal tidal and wave energy can offer new opportunities for cleaner and more efficient power generation by broadening the range of renewable options we can maybe overcome the limitations of individual technologies and create a more balanced energy mix while the transition to renewable energy is alleged to be crucial it is equally important to allocate resources to address pressing environmental challenges investing in the maintenance and construction of infrastructure to handle flooding providing resources to fight wildfires and building resilient cities for mass migration patterns are essential components of a holistic approach to approaching our needs as a species by striking a balance between renewable energy investments and adaptation measures we can create a more resilient future devoid of fearmongering by politicians the current contribution of solar panels and wind turbines to the global energy mix is extremely modest therefore it is crucial to wake up smell the coffee and strike a balance between ‚Äúrenewable‚Äù energy investments and addressing other pressing environmental challenges,2024-07-16,0.4265904725,0.5734095573

1 despite challenges revenues grew back qoq with strong energy and storage despite many challenges the tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues energy storage deployments reached an alltime high in q2 leading to record profits for the energy business and were investing in many future projects including ai training and great infrastructure to support future products we wont get too much into the product road map here because that is reserved for product announcement events but we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year 2 energy growing faster but remains demand rather than production constraint us china should 23x output for the energy business this is growing faster than anything else this is we are really demand constraint rather than production constraint so were ramping up production in our us factory as well as building our building the mega factory in china that should roughly double our output maybe more than maybe triple potentially 3 seeing continued ev adoption but some nearterm hangover with heavy discounting by competitors we saw large adoption acceleration of evs and then a bit of a hangover as others struggles to make compelling uvs so there have been quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market and mostly they have not done well but they have discounted their evs quite substantially which has made it more difficult for tesla we dont see this as a longterm issue but really its fairly short term 4 next gen to be produced on same vehicle lineup less cost efficient but more capex efficient the next gen will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as current vehicle lineup this approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain time 5 subsidized new customers with lower interest rate auto loans on the auto business front a ordability remains top of mind for customers and in response in q2 we offer reducing financing options to offset sustained high interest rates these programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter these impacts will persist into q3 as we have already launched similar programs were now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world this is the best time to buy a tesla 6 merged the two highway and city stacks in fsv v 125 with 5x parameters regarding full selfdriving and robotaxi weve made a lot of progress with full self driving driving in q2 and with version 125 beginning rollout we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervises full selfdriving works version 125 has 5x the parameters of 124 and indiscernible the highway and city stacks so the highway indiscernible at this point is pretty old so often the issues people encounter are on the highway but with 125 we nally merged the 2 stacks 7 fsd can unlock massive potential in the fleet to monetise with high software like margins once people use at all that they tend to continue using it so its very compelling and this i think will be a massive demand driver even unsupervised for selfdriving will be a massive demand driver and as we increase the miles between intervention we will transition from indiscernible full selfdriving to unsupervised full selfdriving and we can unlock massive potential in the fleet 8 tesla fsd is meant to be a generalized solution rather than high density mapping and geofenced i mean our solution is a generalized solution like what everybody else has if you see the indiscernible on t they have very localized solutions that requires highdensity mapping its not its quite fragile so their ability to expand i believe is limited our solution is a general solution that works anywhere 9 once fsd is safer than humans will ask for regulatory approvals will ask soon perhaps by year end so its this capability i think in our experience once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human we find that regulators are supportive of deployment of that capability so i dont think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor i should also say that the selfdriving capabilities that are deployed outside of north america are far behind that in north america so with version 125 and maybe 126 but pretty soon we will ask for regulatory approval of the tesla supervised fsd in europe china and other countries and i think were likely to receive that before the end of the year 10 postponed robotaxi product even to 10 oct instead to improve it more and add things we postponed the sort of robotaxi product unveil by a couple of months where its shifted to 1010 to the 10th of october and this is because i wanted to make some important changes that i think would improve the sort of the robotaxi the thing the main thing that were going to show and were also going to show up a couple of other things so moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the robotaxi as well as add in a couple of other things for the product unveil 11 visualizing how tesla robotaxi will work 247 without drivers like airbnb for transportation this would just be the tesla network you just literally open the tesla app and summon a car and we sent a card and quickly open take somewhere and our we will have a eet thats on the order of 7 million soon in the us come it will be over 10 million then over 20 million this is in that scale and the car is able to operate 247 unlike the human drivers so the capability to like this basically instant scale with a software update and now this is for a customerowned eet so you can think of that as being a bit like airbnb like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet or cancel that and bring it back it will be used by the eet all the time can be used by the eet and some of the time and then telsa take we churn the revenue with the customer 12 optimus already performing tasks in factory v1 for tesla consumption v2 in 2026 for external customers with optimus optimus is already performing tasks in our factory and we expect to have optimist production version 1 and limited production starting early next year this will be for tesla consumption its just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves but we expect to have several thousand optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the tesla factories and then in 2026 ramping up production quite a bit and at that point well be providing optimus robots to outside customers there will be a production version 2 of optimus 13 optimistic about the longterm value of optimus the demand and the potential market opportunity i think the longterm value of optimus will exceed that of everything else that tesla combined so its simply just never consider the usefulness utility of a indiscernible robot thats do pretty much anything you asked it so i suspect that the block to demand for general purpose indiscernible robots is in excess of 20 billion units and tesla has the most advanced human robot in the world and tesla is also very good at manufacturing thats why my rough estimate long term is in accordance with the invest analysis of market capital on the order of 5 trillion‚Ä¶ 14 dojo difficult to get nvidia‚Äôs gpus need to focus on getting the gpus the next question is any update on dojo so dojo i should preface this by saying im incredibly impressed by nvidias execution and the capability of their hardware and what we are seeing is that amount for nvidia hardware is so high that its often diffcult to get the gpus and there just seems theres i guess im quite concerned about actually being able to get steady in gpus and when we want them and i think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on dojo in order to have in order to ensure that weve got the training capability that we need so we are going to double down on dojo and we do see a path to being competitive with nvidia with dojo and i think we kind of have no choice because the demand for nvidia is so high and its obviously there obligation essentially to raise the price of gpus to will bear which is very high so i think weve really got to make dojo work and we will 15 expect continued capex spend on gpus fy24 capex 10bn sequentially our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for airelated activities and higher legal and other costs on the capex front while we saw a sequential decline in q2 we still expect the year to be over 10 billion in capex as we increase our spend to bring a 50 gpu cluster on luck this new center will immensely increase our capabilities to scale fsd and other ai initiatives we reverted to positive fcf of 13 billion in q2 16 first robotaxi ride acknowledge too optimistic this or next year when do you expect the first robotaxi ride elon musk executive i guess that thats really just a question of when we expect the first or when can we do on supervised full selfdriving its difficult obviously my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past so i mean based on the current trend it seems as though we should get miles between interventions be high enough that too far enough to humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year i would be shocked if we cannot do it next year so next year seems highly probable to me based on point simply plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention 17 being flexible on advertising not saying no but will adjust accordingly our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best for a set reasonable price to the consumers just to give you a fact in us alone in q2 over 23 of our sales were to deliveries were to people who had never owned a tesla before and which is encouraging weve spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy were not saying no to advertising but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting in the later half of this year as well 18 thoughtful about not producing in mexico given the likelihood of proposed tariffs well we currently oppose on giga mexico i think we need to see just where things stand after the election trump has said that heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in mexico so it doesnt make sense to invest a lot in mexico if that is going to be the case 19 outlook currently in between two major growth waves from model 3y platform to autonomy new products and next gen energy and storage should grow faster in 2024 our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023 as our teams work on the launch of the next generation vehicle 1h25 and other products in 2024 the growth rates of energy storage deployments and revenue in our energy generation and storage business should outpace the automotive business ‚û°Ô∏è final takeaways tesla tsla tesla is experiencing slower nearterm growth as it is in between two growth waves from model 3 y to nextgen lower priced vehicle fsd optimus and so many other initiatives growth is not linear especially not in car manufacturing with research and production ramp next few quarters and this year will be rockier and they report flattish topline and lower profits with the higher reinvestment and that‚Äôs perfectly okay with me thesis still intact of strong technological product strong operating leverage manufacturing superiority laser focused on profitability and strong fcf generation and reinvestment longterm fsdautonomy with v12 potential to increase current lower hardware profit margins with higher software margins lots of optionality with robotaxisfsd optimus nextgen model and even selling inference compute watch development of services with supercharging fsd licensing and robotaxis much later on strong cash generation and reinvestment opportunities that is highly advantaged in manufacturing efficiency,2024-07-24,0.9865804911,0.01341945026
